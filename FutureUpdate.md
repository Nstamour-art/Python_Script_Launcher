# Possible Improvements for Python Script Launcher

## User Experience Enhancements

-   [ ] **Dynamic Button Layout**: Automatically adjust the button layout based on the window size or number of scripts.
-   [ ] **Search Bar**: Add a search bar to filter scripts dynamically by name.
-   [ ] **Tooltips**: Add tooltips to buttons to display additional information about the script (e.g., description or arguments).
-   [ ] **Customizable Themes**: Allow users to switch between themes (e.g., dark mode, light mode) from the UI.
-   [ ] **User Preferences**: Save user preferences for layout and theme settings.

## Error Handling and Validation

-   [ ] **Script Validation**: Validate that the script is executable and has the correct permissions before launching.
-   [ ] **Detailed Error Messages**: Provide user-friendly error messages in the UI instead of just logging them.
-   [ ] **Config Validation**: Validate the `config.json` structure and provide feedback if it's malformed.

## Configuration Management

-   [ ] **Editable Configurations**: Add a settings page or modal where users can edit configurations (e.g., `ROW_LIMIT`, `ALWAYS`, or script paths) directly from the UI.
-   [ ] **Backup Configurations**: Automatically back up the `config.json` file before making changes.

## Logging and Debugging

-   [ ] **Log Viewer**: Add a log viewer in the UI to display logs in real-time for easier debugging.
-   [ ] **Log Rotation**: Implement log rotation to prevent the `debug.log` file from growing indefinitely.

## Cross-Platform Compatibility

-   [ ] **Platform-Specific Features**: Ensure the launcher works seamlessly on Linux, macOS, and Windows by handling platform-specific quirks (e.g., terminal commands).
-   [ ] **Executable Packaging**: Use tools like `PyInstaller` or `cx_Freeze` to package the launcher as a standalone executable for each platform.

## Script Management

-   [ ] **Add/Remove Scripts**: Allow users to add or remove scripts dynamically through the UI instead of editing `config.json` manually.
-   [ ] **Script Categories**: Group scripts into categories (e.g., "Utilities", "Data Processing") and display them in collapsible sections.

## Improved UI Design

-   [ ] **Resizable Window**: Allow the main window to be resizable and adjust the layout dynamically.
-   [ ] **Icons for Buttons**: Add icons to buttons for better visual appeal and easier identification.
-   [ ] **Progress Indicators**: Show a progress bar or spinner while a script is running.

## Advanced Features

-   [ ] **Script Output Viewer**: Capture and display the output of the script in a separate window or panel.
-   [ ] **Scheduler**: Add a feature to schedule scripts to run at specific times.
-   [ ] **Argument Editor**: Allow users to edit script arguments directly from the UI before launching.

## Testing and Code Quality

-   [ ] **Unit Tests**: Add unit tests for all functions using `pytest` to ensure reliability.
-   [ ] **Linting and Formatting**: Use `flake8` for linting and `black` for consistent code formatting.
-   [ ] **Type Checking**: Use `mypy` to ensure type safety.

## Documentation

-   [ ] **User Guide**: Provide a detailed user guide or help section accessible from the UI.
-   [ ] **Inline Help**: Add inline help or tooltips for settings and buttons.

## Performance Optimization

-   [ ] **Lazy Loading**: Load scripts and configurations lazily to improve startup time.
-   [ ] **Threading**: Run scripts in separate threads or processes to keep the UI responsive.

## Security

-   [ ] **Input Sanitization**: Ensure all user inputs (e.g., script paths, arguments) are sanitized to prevent command injection.
-   [ ] **Permission Checks**: Check if the user has the necessary permissions to execute scripts.

## Versioning and Updates

-   [ ] **Version Display**: Display the current version of the launcher in the UI.
-   [ ] **Auto-Update**: Add a feature to check for updates and download the latest version automatically.
